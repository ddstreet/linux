* Marvell Berlin2 clock bindings

Marvell Berlin2 (BG2, BG2CD, BG2Q) share the same IP for PLLs and clocks,
with some minor differences in features and register layout. The below
describes the individual clock related IP:

* Audio/Video PLL

The Audio/Video PLL (AVPLL) is a dual-VCO PLL with 8 channels each. Each
of the VCOs can sythesize a single VCO frequency based on a single input
reference clock. Each of the 8 channels then, can derive an output clock
from that VCO frequency by various dividers/multipliers.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "marvell,berlin2-avpll"
- reg: address and length of the corresponding AVPLL registers
- #clock-cells: shall be set to 2
- clocks: single clock specifier referencing the AVPLL input clock

To ease match-up with the desired AVPLL output clock, clock specifiers
referencing AVPLL clocks shall contain two cells. The first refers to
the VCO (0=AVPLL_A, 1=AVPLL_B) while the second refers to the corresponding
channel starting with 1. For example, to reference AVPLL_B3 the clock
specifier shall be: <&avpll 1 3>.

Example:

avpll: pll@ea0040 {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin2-avpll";
	#clock-cells = <2>;
	reg = <0xea0050 0x100>;
	clocks = <&refclk>;
};

* Simple PLLs

Simple PLLs are memory mapped PLLs that can sythesize a single output clock
based on a single input reference clock.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of the following:
	"marvell,berlin2-pll" for Berlin BG2/BG2CD PLLs
	"marvell,berlin2q-pll" for Berlin BG2Q PLLs
- reg: address and length of the corresponding PLL registers
- #clock-cells: shall be set to 0
- clocks: single clock specifier referencing the PLL input clock

Example:

cpupll: pll@ea003c {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin2-pll";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0xea003c 0x14>;
	clocks = <&refclk>;
};

* Single-register clock dividers

Single-register clock dividers are complex divider cells, allowing
to divide a reference clock with a set of fixed dividers. Also they
comprise and input clock mux with bypass and an ouput clock gate.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "marvell,berlin2-clk-div"
- reg: address and length of the corresponding DIV registers
- #clock-cells: shall be set to 0
- clocks: clock specifiers referencing the DIV input clocks
- clock-names: array of strings describing the clock specifiers above.
    Allowed clock-names are "mux_bypass" for the clock mux bypass selection
    and "muxN" (N=0..7) for each of the 8 possible clock mux inputs.

Example:

gfx3dcore_clk: clock@ea022c {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin2-clk-div";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0xea0022c 0x4>;
	clocks = <&syspll>,
		<&avpll AVPLL_B 4>, <&avpll AVPLL_B 5>,
		<&avpll AVPLL_B 6>, <&avpll AVPLL_B 7>;
	clock-names = "mux_bypass",
		"mux0", "mux1", "mux2", "mux3";
};

* SoC-specific core clocks

In addition to the above, there is a register set dealing with SoC
specific clock dividers, muxes, and gates. There is also the complex
divider cell used above, but instead of independent registers, they
share a common set of registers. The core clocks are represented by
a single DT node providing access to the remaining clocks.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of
	"marvell,berlin2-core-clocks" for BG2/BG2CD SoCs
	"marvell,berlin2q-core-clocks" for BG2Q SoCs
- reg: address and length of the corresponding clock registers
- #clock-cells: shall be set to 1
- clocks: clock specifiers referencing the core clock input clocks
- clock-names: array of strings describing the clock specifiers above.
    Allowed clock-names for the reference clocks are
      "refclk", "syspll", "mempll", "cpupll"
    also Audio/Video PLL clocks shall be named with
      "avpll_VN" (V=0...1 for AVPLL_A and AVPLL_B, N=1..8 for the
      corresponding reference input from AVPLL).

Optional properties for BG2/BG2CD SoCs:
- clocks/clock-names: in addition to the allowed clock names above,
    there is an external video clock input that shall be named "video_ext0".

Clocks provided by core clocks shall be referenced by a clock specifier
indexing one of the provided clocks. A SoC-specific list of available clocks
is below the example.

Example:
coreclk: clock@ea0150 {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin2-core-clocks";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	reg = <0xea0150 0x1c>;
	clocks = <&refclk>, <&syspll>, <&mempll>, <&cpupll>,
		<&avpll 0 1>, <&avpll 0 2>,
		<&avpll 0 3>, <&avpll 0 4>,
		<&avpll 0 5>, <&avpll 0 6>,
		<&avpll 0 7>, <&avpll 0 8>,
		<&avpll 1 1>, <&avpll 1 2>,
		<&avpll 1 3>, <&avpll 1 4>,
		<&avpll 1 5>, <&avpll 1 6>,
		<&avpll 1 7>, <&avpll 1 8>,
		<&externalvideoclk>;
	clock-names = "refclk", "syspll", "mempll", "cpupll",
		"avpll_a1", "avpll_a2", "avpll_a3", "avpll_a4",
		"avpll_a5", "avpll_a6", "avpll_a7", "avpll_a8",
		"avpll_b1", "avpll_b2", "avpll_b3", "avpll_b4",
		"avpll_b5", "avpll_b6", "avpll_b7", "avpll_b8",
		"video_ext0";
